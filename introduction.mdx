## Welcome to the Tokn Ledger API

The Tokn Ledger API allows you to manage digital assets, projects, wallets, and transactions in a secure and efficient manner. Whether you're building a loyalty program, a virtual currency system, or any other application that requires digital asset management, this API provides the tools you need.

## Key Concepts

Before diving into the specific endpoints, let's review some key concepts:

- **Assets**: Digital representations of value (e.g., loyalty points, virtual currencies).
- **Projects**: Containers for assets and wallets, allowing you to organize your digital economy.
- **Wallets**: Stores of assets, which can be owned by customers or the system.
- **Transactions**: Movements of assets between wallets.
